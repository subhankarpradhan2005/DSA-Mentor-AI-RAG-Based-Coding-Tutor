# 🧠 DSA Mentor AI

> An AI-powered DSA learning and coding assistant that helps students understand problems, write code, execute solutions, and improve through personalized AI feedback.

## 📌 Overview

DSA Mentor AI is an intelligent learning platform designed to help students practice Data Structures and Algorithms through guided problem solving.

Unlike traditional coding platforms that mainly provide a **Correct/Wrong** verdict, DSA Mentor AI focuses on the **learning process**.

The system allows a student to:

- Select or explore DSA problems
- Ask conceptual questions
- Get AI-powered explanations and hints
- Write and submit code
- Execute code against test cases
- Analyze execution results
- Receive personalized feedback
- Improve and re-submit the solution

The core learning loop is:

```text
Problem
   ↓
Student Attempt
   ↓
Code Execution
   ↓
Test Case Evaluation
   ↓
AI Feedback / Hint
   ↓
Student Improves Solution
   ↓
Re-submit
````

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Students often struggle with DSA because knowing the syntax is not enough.

Traditional coding platforms usually provide:

```text
Submit Code
     ↓
Accepted / Wrong Answer
```

This tells the student **what happened**, but not always **why it happened or how to improve**.

DSA Mentor AI addresses this problem by combining:

* DSA knowledge retrieval
* AI tutoring
* Code execution
* Test-case evaluation
* Personalized feedback

The objective is to make the system behave more like a **DSA mentor** rather than just a coding judge.

# 🚀 Key Features

## 1. AI DSA Tutor

Students can ask questions about:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Searching
* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* Recursion
* Strings
* Other DSA concepts

The AI provides explanations and guidance based on the problem context.

---

## 2. RAG-based Knowledge Retrieval

The project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

```text
Student Question
       ↓
Query Processing
       ↓
Embedding
       ↓
Vector Retrieval
       ↓
Relevant DSA Knowledge
       ↓
LLM
       ↓
Contextual Response
```

This allows the AI to use relevant DSA knowledge instead of relying only on the model's general knowledge.

---

## 3. Code Execution

Students can submit their code for execution.

The execution workflow is:

```text
Student Code
     ↓
Code Executor
     ↓
Test Case Runner
     ↓
Actual Output
     ↓
Expected Output
     ↓
Evaluation
```

The system captures execution results and uses them for further analysis.

---

## 4. Test Case Evaluation

The submitted solution is tested against predefined test cases.

The system compares:

```text
Expected Output
       vs
Actual Output
```

and determines whether the solution passes or fails.

---

## 5. AI Feedback Agent

When a student's solution fails, the feedback workflow analyzes the execution result.

Instead of only returning:

```text
Wrong Answer
```

the system can provide targeted guidance such as:

```text
Check how you update the left and right
boundaries after calculating mid.
```

The objective is to help the student discover and fix the mistake.

---

## 6. Human-in-the-Loop Learning

The student remains actively involved in solving the problem.

```text
AI gives problem
       ↓
Student writes solution
       ↓
System evaluates
       ↓
AI provides hint
       ↓
Student improves solution
       ↓
System evaluates again
```

The AI is designed to assist the learner instead of simply replacing the learner.

# 🧠 Why RAG?

A general LLM may provide a correct but generic response.

RAG allows the system to retrieve relevant knowledge before generating the answer.

For example:

```text
Question:
"Why is binary search O(log n)?"

       ↓

Retrieve:
Binary Search concept
Time complexity
Search space reduction

       ↓

LLM

       ↓

Context-aware explanation
```

This makes the tutor more relevant to the DSA learning domain.

---

# 🤖 Agent Design

The project uses a modular AI workflow rather than depending on a single monolithic AI component.

Major components include:

```text
RAG Component
      ↓
Knowledge Retrieval

Code Execution Component
      ↓
Code + Test Case Evaluation

Feedback Component
      ↓
Execution Result → AI Feedback
```

This modular design makes the system easier to test, maintain, and extend.

> LangGraph/CrewAI are not currently required for the core workflow because the current execution and tutoring flow is controlled and modular. A graph-based orchestration layer can be considered as a future enhancement for more complex multi-agent workflows.

---

# 🐳 Containerization

The backend can be containerized using Docker.

Docker helps provide:

* Reproducible environments
* Consistent dependencies
* Easier deployment
* Separation of application services
* Simplified development setup

The project also includes Docker Compose configuration for running required services together.

---

# 🗃️ Database Migrations

Alembic is used to manage database schema changes.

Migration history includes changes related to:

* Users
* Problems
* Problem solution metadata
* Solution code metadata

This allows database schema changes to remain version-controlled.

---

# 📡 API Modules

The backend exposes APIs for different parts of the application.

Main API modules include:

```text
/api/auth
/api/chat
/api/documents
/api/execution
/api/execution-feedback
/api/problems
```

These APIs connect the React frontend with the backend services.

---

# 🔐 Security Considerations

Code execution systems require careful isolation.

The project uses containerization as part of the deployment architecture.

For production deployment, additional execution sandboxing and resource restrictions should be applied, including:

* CPU limits
* Memory limits
* Execution timeouts
* Process isolation
* Restricted filesystem access
* Restricted network access

---

# 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of DSA Mentor AI is to transform DSA practice from:

```text
Problem → Code → Verdict
```

into:

```text
Problem
   ↓
Understand
   ↓
Attempt
   ↓
Execute
   ↓
Analyze
   ↓
Get Guidance
   ↓
Improve
   ↓
Solve
```

The system focuses on **learning through guided problem solving** rather than simply providing final solutions.
